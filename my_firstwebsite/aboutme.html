    <h1>It's all about me?  Why thank you!</h1>
    <br><h3>Growing up in Oakland, I always knew that community was 
    important and giving back was expected.  Friends, family, 
    and laughter brings a positive energy to my life.  As I follow God's purpose
    for me which is to inform the underrepresented population about STEAM,
    then I know that I am playing my part in society.</h3>
